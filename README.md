# Fashion MNIST Data Classification

This repository contains code that implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset. The code is written in Python and utilizes the Keras library for deep learning.

## Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images representing various clothing items. It serves as a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. 

## Code Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- `FASHION_MNIST_DATA_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code implementation and detailed explanation of the CNN model for Fashion MNIST classification.

## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib).
3. Open the `FASHION_MNIST_DATA_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.
4. Execute the code cells sequentially to train the CNN model, evaluate its performance, and generate predictions.

## Results

After running the code, you will obtain the following:

- Trained CNN model capable of classifying Fashion MNIST images.
- Evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and loss, indicating the model's performance on the testing set.
- Predictions made by the model on sample test images, along with the true labels and corresponding images.

Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different configurations to improve the model's performance.
